bio:
  - Hello from Pokhara, Nepal! I'm deeply passionate about the tech world, 
    focusing on data science, graphic design, and full-stack web development.
    Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Your University/School Name], 
    I'm embracing the ever-evolving tech landscape.
    My skill set spans various web development frameworks like Flask, FastAPI, and Django, 
    coupled with a flair for front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Vue.js. On the creative side, 
    I bring design ideas to life using tools like Illustrator and Figma.
    Data science captivates me, and I've delved into web scraping using tools like Selenium and Scrapy,
    extracting valuable insights from diverse datasets. Beyond the classroom, I actively apply my skills
    in hackathons and collaborative projects.
    Based in the beautiful city of Pokhara, I'm excited to contribute to the local tech community and explore 
    opportunities that align with my passion and expertise. If your organization is on the lookout for a tech 
    enthusiast ready to make a positive impact, I'd love to connect!
  # - In my adventures, I combined biology and programming because I was
  #   fascinated by how living things resemble computers. Programming life is a
  #   problem just as difficult and satisfying as programming silicon.
  - I'm looking for interesting and challenging employment at a remote-friendly
    company with a great culture and opportunities for advancement. Let's talk
    together about solving problems with technology.

location: Capable of working remotely. Living in **Pokhara**, Nepal.

      Mitho-Mitho is a web application designed to let foodies search restaurants,
      track their eating history, as well as connect with friends. If you have trouble 
      remembering what restaurants you’ve been to before, or what you’ve ordered at a 
      restaurant that was good, then Mitho-Mitho is your go-to app.
      Search for restaurants by name or address. With the queried results, you can select
      and add a restaurant that you have visited 
      to your own personal map, leaving behind a trail of Mitho-Mithos for your
      restaurant history. Connect with friends to see where your 
      friends have dined at and what dishes they've tried. Mitho-Mitho is a social media 
      network built for foodies.
