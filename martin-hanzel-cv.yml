bio:
  - I'm a computer scientist, a genetic engineer, a mentor, and a successful
    geek. I love to share my passion for technology with everyone around me. I
    live in Lausanne, Switzerland, where I'm working towards a Master's degree
    at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in one of the best computer
    science courses in the world.
  # - In my adventures, I combined biology and programming because I was
  #   fascinated by how living things resemble computers. Programming life is a
  #   problem just as difficult and satisfying as programming silicon.
  - I'm looking for interesting and challenging employment at a remote-friendly
    company with a great culture and opportunities for advancement. Let's talk
    together about solving problems with technology.
location: Capable of working remotely. Living in **Lausanne**, Switzerland.
  Able to live+work in Canada, EU, and Switzerland.
